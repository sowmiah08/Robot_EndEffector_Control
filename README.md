# Robot End-Effector Control

This project simulates a 3-DOF planar RRR (Revolute-Revolute-Revolute) robot arm tracking a moving target in 2D space. It includes inverse kinematics, PID control and optional obstacle avoidance using repulsion force field. Animations are created using `matplotlib`.

## Implementations

- 2D Cartesian tracking of a moving sinusoidal target
- Inverse kinematics solver for RRR manipulator
- PID-based joint control with integral and derivative terms
- Obstacle repulsion modeled using a virtual force field
- Real-time animation of robot arm and end-effector path

---

## Setup and Run the Code

### Prerequisites

- Ensure docker and docker-compose is installed and running.

### Run with obstacle:

```bash
docker compose --profile sim-obstacle up --build
```
### Run without obstacle:

```bash
docker compose --profile sim up --build
```

Each launches a side-by-side animation of the robot behavior at:
- 5 Hz target / 50 Hz control rate
- 30 Hz target / 1000 Hz control rate

## Description of Our Approach

This project simulates the Cartesian trajectory tracking of a 3-DOF planar RRR robotic manipulator. The robot is designed to follow a time-varying target in a 2D space using inverse kinematics and a basic PID joint controller. Key components of the simulation include:

- **Trajectory Generation**: A sinusoidal path is generated for the end-effector using defined target frequency and duration.
- **Inverse Kinematics (IK)**: The system computes all valid joint configurations for a given target using closed-form solutions for the planar RRR arm.
- **PID Controller**: Joint angles are regulated using a proportionalâ€“integralâ€“derivative control loop that attempts to minimize error over time.
- **Obstacle Avoidance**: An optional circular obstacle introduces repulsive forces near its boundary, modifying the target dynamically to avoid collisions.
- **Visualization**: Real-time simulation is rendered using `matplotlib.animation`, showing the robot arm, target path, and end-effector trajectory.

Two simulation configurations are supported:
- **Without obstacle**: Simple target tracking using IK and PID.
- **With obstacle**: Dynamically adjusts motion based on virtual repulsion from the obstacle.
